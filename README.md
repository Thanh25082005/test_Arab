**Arabic handwritten text recognition** — line-level OCR (a line or paragraph
image → Arabic text), trained on the **KHATT** dataset.

What makes it Arabic-specific rather than a generic CRNN:

- **3-zone vertical pooling** — preserves *where* dots sit (above vs below the
  baseline), the only difference between ب/ت/ث and ن/ي
- **Input height 96** — keeps diacritic dots large enough (3–5 px) for 3×3
  convolutions to detect
- **Dot-safe augmentation** — shear, kashida stretch, mild rotation; erosion /
  dilation / elastic are banned because they destroy 2–4 px dots
- **Beam-search decoding with an Arabic character bigram LM**
- **Dot-group CER metric** — tracks errors on dot-differentiated letter groups,
  the #1 Arabic OCR error source

## Install

```bash
pip install arabicocr-khatt
```

## Quickstart

```python
from arabicocr_khatt import ArabicOCR

ocr = ArabicOCR.from_pretrained()        # downloads weights from the HF Hub
text = ocr.recognize("handwritten_page.jpg")   # multi-line pages segmented automatically
print(text)
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
arabicocr handwritten_page.jpg
arabicocr line.png --no-segment --greedy       # single line, fastest decode
arabicocr scan.jpg --checkpoint runs/exp1/crnn_best.pt   # local weights
```

## Architecture

```
Input [B, 1, 96, 1536] grayscale
  → CNN (7 conv layers, full BatchNorm, Dropout2d)
  → adaptive pool to 3 vertical zones (dot position preserved)
  → 2-layer BiLSTM(1536 → 384)
  → FC → CTC loss
  → greedy or beam-search decode (+ Arabic bigram LM), reversed back to RTL
```

Preprocessing (shared between training and inference): grayscale → CLAHE →
dual-polarity Otsu binarization → LANCZOS resize to H=96 → pad to W=1536.

## Training your own model

Get the KHATT dataset (request access at [khatt.ideas2serve.net](https://khatt.ideas2serve.net/))
and lay it out as:

```text
archive/
├─ images/   *.jpg            # line images
├─ labels/   *.txt            # Arabic text (Windows-1256 / UTF-8)
└─ splits/                    # auto-created train/val/test CSVs (80/10/10)
```

Then, with the training extras installed:

```bash
pip install -e ".[train]"
python -m arabicocr_khatt.train_crnn_ctc                 # trains to runs/exp1
python -m arabicocr_khatt.show_metrics --run ./runs/exp1 # inspect metrics
python -m arabicocr_khatt.monitor                        # live training dashboard
```

Training uses OneCycleLR, gradient accumulation, early stopping, and logs
per-epoch CER / WER / WER(norm) / dot-group CER to `runs/<exp>/metrics.csv`.
Checkpoints are saved as `{"model": state_dict, "vocab": [...], "arch_version": 2}`.

## Web test bench (Gradio)

A rich debugging UI with crop/rotate, polarity control, decoder comparison,
confidence heatmaps, char-level diff against ground truth, and batch evaluation:

```bash
pip install -e ".[demo]"
python -m arabicocr_khatt.webocr

# shared multi-GPU server: pin a GPU and pick a free port
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python -m arabicocr_khatt.webocr --port 7861   # --host 0.0.0.0 / --share
```

The **Crop & Test** tab lets you upload a page, press-drag-release to crop a
region, and see the recognition, a line-by-line check (each line image above its
text), CER/WER against an optional ground truth, and a per-session history of
all crops (exportable as TSV). Three engines:

| Engine | For | How |
|---|---|---|
| Qari-OCR v0.4 | typed / printed Arabic | Qwen3-VL-4B + Arabic LoRA (4-bit), one request per line |
| Handwriting | pen handwriting, phone photos, ruled paper | Kraken baseline line finder + sherif v3 (Qwen2.5-VL-3B HTR), 5 differently-cropped readings, word-level majority vote; words the readings disagree on are marked `[؟]` |
| KHATT CRNN | clean scanned handwriting lines | this repo's model |

On a 1972 handwritten contract (phone photo, ruled paper) the handwriting engine
recovers ~61% of the reference words vs ~18% for the previous pipeline; words it
leaves unflagged are ~70% correct, words flagged `[؟]` ~12%.

```bash
pip install -e ".[demo,vlm]"
# Kraken pins its own torch: give it a separate venv and point the demo at it
python -m uv venv ~/venvs/kraken && python -m uv pip install -p ~/venvs/kraken/bin/python \
    --torch-backend cpu "kraken>=6"
export ARABICOCR_KRAKEN_PY=~/venvs/kraken/bin/python
export ARABICOCR_VLM_BUDGET_GB=4.6     # hard VRAM cap for the VLM engines (shared GPUs)
```

## Publishing weights to the Hub

After training (on the machine that has `runs/` and `archive/`):

```bash
hf auth login
python scripts/upload_to_hf.py --run-dir runs/exp1
```

This validates the checkpoint, builds the bigram LM from the training split,
fills the model card with your best-epoch metrics, and uploads everything to
[FixFips/arabicocr-khatt](https://huggingface.co/FixFips/arabicocr-khatt).

## Notes and limitations

- Trained on KHATT: performance is best on handwriting similar to that dataset.
  Printed fonts, very noisy backgrounds, or strongly curved text may fail.
- Line-level model: pages are segmented into lines with classical morphology;
  complex layouts may segment poorly.
- Labels use Windows-1256 encoding (KHATT standard); the reader falls back to
  UTF-8 automatically.
